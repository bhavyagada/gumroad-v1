				<h4 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#333] mb-2.5">What is this built with?</h4>
				<p class="w-4/5 leading-[160%] text-[#555] mx-0 my-4">Gumroad is built on top of Google's App Engine and uses a lovely combination of HTML/CSS/Javascript for front-end stuff and Python for back-end stuff. There was no Photoshop involved in the process of building Gumroad - except for the favicon! We use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409184753/http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payments and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409184753/http://letscrate.com/">Crate</a> for hosting files.</p>

				<h4 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#333] mb-2.5">What can I charge per link?</h4>
				<p class="w-4/5 leading-[160%] text-[#555] mx-0 my-4">Each link must be at least $0.99 and can go up to $999.00 — you can specify free links too, if you so choose. Free links will redirect automatically and viewers will never hit a payment wall.</p>

				<h4 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#333] mb-2.5">What's with the name?</h4>
				<p class="w-4/5 leading-[160%] text-[#555] mx-0 my-4">I had the domain. No, seriously. I think a lot of people get caught up with thinking about a name and never even end up releasing a product. So I decided I would stick wth a domain I already had and build something. Two days later, I had.</p>

				<h4 class="font-bold text-xl text-[#333] mb-2.5">Who made Gumroad?</h4>
				<p class="w-4/5 leading-[160%] text-[#555] mx-0 my-4">I did. My name's Sahil Lavingia and you can read more about me by clicking that link in the footer. Put simply, I feel like shit when I'm not making stuff. Gumroad is just one of the many things I've built. There's much more to come so you should follow me on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409184753/http://twitter.com/slavingia/">Twitter</a> if that interests you.</p>
